# Py-Functions-Task

List=[1,2,3,4]
## Tasks:


- Question 1: Write a function that takes two numbers and return their sum 
def sumFunc(num1,num2):
sum = num1+ num2
print (sum)
sumFunv(3,5)

- Question 2: Prints all the elements in the list using a for loop
myList= [1, 2, 3,4]
for num in myList:
  print(num)
  
- Question 3: Write a Python program to sum all the items in the list 
sumList = 0
for num in myList:
sumList = SumList + num
print ('the sum for myList is ',sumList)

- Question 4: Write a Python program to get the largest number from the list
laggestNum = 0
for num > lagg in MyList
if num > laggestNum:
laggestNum= num
print ('the laggest number is: ',laggestNum)

- Question 5: write a function that take a list and a number then return a new partial list starting from index 0 to index "number"

- Question 6: Loop through the letters in the string: "Tuwaiq_Academy
name = "Tuwaiq_Academy"
for x in name:
print(x)

- Question 7: Consider this ``` list = ["Python", "C++", "Java"] ``` Exit the loop when x is equal to "C++"
List = [python,"C++","Java"]
for x in list :
if x =='c++'
break
print x
- Question 8: Write a function that receives a list containing different numbers, rearranges the list so that the zeros are the end of the list, and finally returns the arranged list
def arrage (list1):
    for i in list1:
    if i==0
    list.remove(i)
    list.append(0)
    return print(list1)
    list = [0,3,0,5,7,9]
    arrange(list1)


## Additional Challenge:


- Build a phone book program that receives the phone number, and returns the name of the owner.
You can follow the table below:

## Contact Table

| Name | Number |
| --- | ------------- |
| Ahmed | 0551112222 |
| Saad | 0551113333 |
| Sultan | 0551114444 |
| Morad | 0551115555 |
| Abdullah| 0551116666 |

This is the list of dictionaries you can use to build this function:

```contactTable=[{"name":"Ahmed","Phone":"0551112222"},{"name":"Saad","Phone":"0551113333"},{"name":"Sultan","Phone":"0551114444"},{"name":"Morad","Phone":"0551115555"},{"name":"Abdullah","Phone":"0551116666"}] ```

- If the number exists, print the owner. Otherwise, print "Sorry, the number is not found".
- If the number is less or more than 10 numbers, print "This is invalid number".
- If the number contains letters or symbols, print "This is invalid number".


## Submission:
